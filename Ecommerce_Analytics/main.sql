-- ðŸ”Ž Observations and Conclusions:
-- The column DASM have almost 40 percent value is null there is many in company when DISTRIC Area Sales Manager not availbale then it's handle by reginal sales manager
-- So replace NULL VALYE IN DASM WITH RSM(reginal sales manager)
-- Change Order Date data type to Date.
-- Change customer No column datatype to datetime2
-- Changes column TimeStamp datatype to datetime2.
-- Changes column Customer number to integer
-- Rename column timestamp otherwise it could conflict due to timestamp is reserved word in msqlserver
-- The values in column Order number need to be split because it contains Store ID along with Order number with delimeter '/'.
-- The columns Order number should be int instead of varchar.
-- Area could be merged in one entity rather than east west or south north but comapy has fixed it based on potential of business
-- so for big data it make sense to do but i do not think it would be better here so skip it. 
-- Delivery amount seeing higher than order amount due to manual data entry of driver so it needed to fix.
-- Order amount of sugar and FMCG(other than staples and dryfruits) is very less frequent and contains zero
-- Due to high cost here comapre to local delership and it's not company core product and very less profit margin 
-- so it could be avoided we are going to do overall sales analysis that's what company core business staples
-- There are 12740 rows and 15 columns between the date of 01-02-2023 and 31-10-2023
