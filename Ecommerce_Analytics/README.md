# Data Cleaning Process Overview

The data cleaning process for the `salesdata` table involves several steps to ensure the data is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis. Below is the steps involved in this process:

Datasets Overview:
The datasets is taken from [Superzop](https://www.superzop.com/), a B2B e-commerce startup revolutionizing staples procurement, and encompass essential information crucial for developing their single largest procurement platform. These datasets include details on stores, customers, and orders, serving as the backbone for Superzop's mission to directly source staples from farmers and mills for B2B customers like small retailers and restaurants.

## Data Investigation 👀

- Examine the structure of the dataset, including the number of rows and columns.
- Check for any obvious issues such as unexpected data types or missing values.
- Investigate any columns with unusual patterns or unexpected values that may require further attention during cleaning.

## Handling Missing Values 🕵️‍♂️

- Identify columns with missing values.
- Decide whether to remove rows with missing values or impute missing values using appropriate techniques (e.g., mean, median, mode imputation).
- Implement SQL queries to handle missing values based on the chosen approach.

## Removing Duplicates 🚫

- Identify duplicate rows based on a combination of relevant columns.
- Use SQL queries with window functions or common table expressions (CTEs) to identify and remove duplicate rows.

## Standardizing Data Formats 📅

- Ensure that date, time, and other formatted columns are consistent across the dataset.
- Convert data types and formats using SQL functions (e.g., CONVERT, CAST, FORMAT).

## Handling Inconsistent Data 🔄

- Identify columns with inconsistent data (e.g., different spellings, abbreviations, or capitalization).
- Use SQL queries with CASE statements, string functions, or regular expressions to standardize inconsistent data.

## Creating Derived Columns ➕

- Identify the need for new columns based on the analysis requirements.
- Use SQL queries to create derived columns from existing columns (e.g., calculating age from date of birth, extracting month or year from date columns).

## Filtering and Subsetting Data 🔍

- Identify and remove irrelevant or unnecessary columns.
- Subset the data based on specific criteria (e.g., filtering for a particular hotel, date range, or customer type).

## Data Validation ✅

- Implement checks and constraints to ensure data integrity and validity.
- Use SQL queries to identify and handle outliers or invalid data points.

The `salesdata` dataset is initially imported as a CSV file into MySQL to begin the data cleaning process. Throughout the cleaning process, steps taken and any assumptions made are documented to ensure transparency and reproducibility. Once the data cleaning process is complete, the cleaned and transformed dataset will be ready for further analysis, such as exploring descriptive statistics, building predictive models, or generating insights and recommendations for business decision-making.
