# Data Cleaning Process Overview

The data cleaning process for the `salesdata` table involves several steps to ensure the data is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis. Below is the steps involved in this process:

Datasets Overview:
The datasets is taken from [Superzop](https://www.superzop.com/), a B2B e-commerce startup revolutionizing staples procurement and have mission to directly source staples from farmers and mills for B2B customers like small retailers and restaurants.This datasets include details on stores, customers, and orders,date,ASM,DSM,area and more.. 

## Data Investigation üëÄ

- Examine the structure of the dataset, including the number of rows and columns.
- Check for any obvious issues such as unexpected data types or missing values.
- Investigate any columns with unusual patterns or unexpected values that may require further attention during cleaning.

## Handling Missing Values üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

- Identify columns with missing values.
- Decide whether to remove rows with missing values or impute missing values using appropriate techniques (e.g., mean, median, mode imputation).
- Implement SQL queries to handle missing values based on the chosen approach.

## Removing Duplicates üö´

- Identify duplicate rows based on a combination of relevant columns.
- Use SQL queries with window functions or common table expressions (CTEs) to identify and remove duplicate rows.

## Handling Inconsistent Data üîÑ

- Identify columns with inconsistent data (e.g., different spellings, abbreviations, or capitalization).
- Use SQL queries with CASE statements, string functions, or regular expressions to standardize inconsistent data.

## Standardizing Data Formats üìÖ

- Ensure that date, time, and other formatted columns are consistent across the dataset.
- Convert data types and formats using SQL functions (e.g., CONVERT, CAST, FORMAT).

## Creating Derived Columns ‚ûï

- Identify the need for new columns based on the analysis requirements.
- Use SQL queries to create derived columns from existing columns (e.g., calculating age from date of birth, extracting month or year from date columns).

## Filtering and Subsetting Data üîç

- Identify and remove irrelevant or unnecessary columns.
- Subset the data based on specific criteria (e.g., filtering for a particular hotel, date range, or customer type).

## Data Validation ‚úÖ

- Implement checks and constraints to ensure data integrity and validity.
- Use SQL queries to identify and handle outliers or invalid data points.

The `salesdata` dataset is initially imported as a CSV file into MySQL to begin the data cleaning process. Throughout the cleaning process, steps taken and any assumptions made are documented to ensure transparency and reproducibility. Once the data cleaning process is complete, the cleaned and transformed dataset will be ready for further analysis, such as exploring descriptive statistics, building predictive models, or generating insights and recommendations for business decision-making.


Here's the formatted version with concise descriptions for the provided SQL queries:


# Data Investigation üëÄ

## Checking Table Structure and Data Types
```sql
-- Checking table structure and column details
EXEC sp_columns salesdata;

-- Checking columns and their data types
SELECT
    COLUMN_NAME,
    DATA_TYPE,
    CHARACTER_MAXIMUM_LENGTH,
    IS_NULLABLE
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'salesdata';
```

## Checking Data Sample
```sql
-- Retrieving a sample of data
SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM salesdata
ORDER BY NEWID();
```

## Identifying Unique Values in Categorical Columns
```sql
Retrieving distinct values from categorical columns
SELECT DISTINCT Area FROM salesdata;
SELECT DISTINCT ASM FROM salesdata;
SELECT DISTINCT DASM FROM salesdata;
SELECT DISTINCT SalesMan FROM salesdata;
```

## Table Size and Date Range
```sql
Counting the number of rows
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_rows
FROM salesdata;

Counting the number of columns
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_columns
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'salesdata';

Retrieving the date range of the data
SELECT MAX(Order_Date), MIN(Order_Date)
FROM salesdata;
```

## Handling Missing Values
```sql
-- Checking for missing/null values
SELECT
    SUM(CASE WHEN Store_ID IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS store_ids,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Store_Name IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS names,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Area IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS areas,
    SUM(CASE WHEN ASM IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS asm,
    SUM(CASE WHEN DASM IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS dasm,
    SUM(CASE WHEN SalesMan IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS salesmen,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Customer_No IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS customer_nos,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Order_Number IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS order_numbers,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Order_Date IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS order_dates,
    SUM(CASE WHEN TimeStamp IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS timestamps,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Ordered_Value IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ordered_values,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Delivered_Value IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS delivered_values,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Sugar IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS sugar,
    SUM(CASE WHEN FMCG IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS fmcg,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Delivered_Amt_without_Sugar_FMCG IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_delivered_amt_without_sugar_fmcg
FROM salesdata;
```

## Observations and Conclusions

- The column DASM has around 40% null values, which may represent cases where a District Area Sales Manager is not available, and the Regional Sales Manager (RSM) handles the responsibility.
- Replace NULL values in the DASM column with 'RSM' (Regional Sales Manager).
- Change the data type of the Order_Date column to DATE.
- Change the data type of the Customer_No column to DATETIME2.
- Change the data type of the TimeStamp column to DATETIME2.
- Change the data type of the Customer_Number column to INTEGER.
- Rename the TimeStamp column to avoid conflicts with the reserved word 'TIMESTAMP' in SQL Server.
- The values in the Order_Number column need to be split because they contain both the Store ID and Order Number, separated by a delimiter '/'.
- The Order_Number column should be of the INTEGER data type instead of VARCHAR.
- The Area column could be merged into one entity rather than separating it into east, west, south, or north, but the company has already fixed it based on the potential business.
- The Delivered_Value is sometimes higher than the Ordered_Value due to manual data entry by drivers, and this needs to be fixed.
- The Order_Amount for Sugar and FMCG (other than staples and dry fruits) is very low and frequently contains zeros, which could be avoided as it is not the company's core product and has a low profit margin.
- The analysis will focus on overall sales, which is the company's core business (staples).
- The dataset contains 12,740 rows and 15 columns, spanning the date range from 01-02-2023 to 31-10-2023.

Here's the formatted version with concise descriptions for the data preprocessing queries:

```markdown
# Data Preprocessing

## Handling Inconsistent Data

```sql
-- Rename TIMESTAMP column
EXEC sp_rename 'salesdata.TIMESTAMP', 'Time_stamp', 'COLUMN';

-- Updating Order_Number
UPDATE salesdata
SET Order_Number = SUBSTRING(Order_Number, CHARINDEX('/', Order_Number) + 1, LEN(Order_Number));
```

## Standardizing Data Formats

```sql
-- Convert Order_Date data type to DATE
UPDATE salesdata
SET Order_Date = CONVERT(DATE, Order_Date, 105);

ALTER TABLE salesdata
ALTER COLUMN Order_Date DATE;

-- Convert Time_Stamp column data type to DATETIME2
UPDATE salesdata
SET Time_Stamp = CONVERT(DATETIME2, Time_Stamp, 105);

ALTER TABLE salesdata
ALTER COLUMN Time_Stamp DATETIME2;

-- Change data type of Order_Number to INT
ALTER TABLE salesdata
ALTER COLUMN Order_Number INT;

-- Change data type of Customer_No to BIGINT
UPDATE salesdata
SET Customer_No = CONVERT(BIGINT, Customer_No, 105);

-- Handle non-numeric values in Customer_No
UPDATE salesdata
SET Customer_No = CASE WHEN ISNUMERIC(Customer_No) = 0 THEN '0' ELSE Customer_No END;

ALTER TABLE salesdata
ALTER COLUMN Customer_No BIGINT;
```

## Creating Derived Columns

```sql
-- Correct Delivered_Value column
UPDATE salesdata
SET Delivered_Value = (
    CASE
        WHEN Delivered_Value = FLOOR(Ordered_Value) OR Delivered_Value = CEILING(Ordered_Value) THEN Ordered_Value
        ELSE Delivered_Value
    END
)

-- Add Undelivered_Value column
ALTER TABLE salesdata
ADD Undelivered_Value FLOAT;

UPDATE salesdata
SET Undelivered_Value = ROUND(ABS((Delivered_Value - Ordered_Value)), 2)

-- Handle NULL values in Undelivered_Value
UPDATE salesdata
SET Undelivered_Value = 0 WHERE Undelivered_Value IS NULL;
```

## Filtering and Subsetting Data

```sql
-- Drop unnecessary columns
ALTER TABLE salesdata
DROP COLUMN Delivered_Amt_without_Sugar_FMCG,
DROP COLUMN FMCG,
DROP COLUMN Sugar;
```

## Data Cleaned and Ready for Analysis

```sql
-- Check the data
SELECT * FROM salesdata;

-- View data types and columns
SELECT
    COLUMN_NAME,
    DATA_TYPE,
    CHARACTER_MAXIMUM_LENGTH,
    IS_NULLABLE
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'salesdata';
```
